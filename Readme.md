# Rlox

Rlox is a toy programming language written in Rust.

Rlox is made for learning how to write interpreters. I have been reading [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) to learn how to build interpreters.

To learn how to use this langauge refer to the [sample.rlox](./sample.rlox) file which contains all the featues this langauge has.

## Building

1. Make sure that you are Rust complier installed and all of it's dependencies
2. Run `cargo build` or `cargo run` to build or run the interpreter

## Grammar

If you are interested in the grammar definition of this language you can read it [here](./Grammar.md)
